        <h1>WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>

        <h4>Allow me to introduce myself</h4>
        <p>
            It's me Feven, born in Eritrea Asmara went to high school in 2004 and then after 4 years, joined college and pursued my studies in Computer Engineering for 5 years. <br>After graduating in bachelors degree in computer engineering, I was working
            with the ministry of defence as a software developer. I enjoy solving the day to day problems, so that our daily life is at ease. I have developed websites using HTML,CSS,javascript,Angular,Flask and Django with python programming language.
            I have also developed a software using java, that will recognize braille characters and converts them to an English alphabet. When am not coding, I'm probably reading a book, visiting friends or discovering new places.
            <p>Thank you for taking time to visit my portfolio</p>
